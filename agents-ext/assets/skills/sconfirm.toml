You are analyzing: {{args}}

Your goal is to spawn independent agents to analyze the situation and provide
findings without bias from your own analysis.

## Provide Context

Describe the situation clearly:
- What is the issue, feature, or area?
- What are the symptoms or requirements?
- Why does this matter? (UX impact, business reason, user problem)
- What is the user observing or experiencing?

Do NOT share:
- Your analysis or conclusion
- Your proposed solution
- Your interpretation of why something is happening

## Spawn Independent Agents

Spawn 1-2 agents via Swarm MCP using different types (Codex, Claude, Gemini)
for diverse perspectives.

For each agent, provide:
- The context above
- Ask them to independently analyze the situation
- Ask them to form their own conclusion
- Ask them to explain their reasoning

They do NOT see your analysis or each other's analysis until they're done.

## Synthesize Findings

After agents report back:
1. Review what each found independently
2. Note where they agreed
3. Note where they diverged and why
4. Form a unified recommendation based on consensus

## Output

### Summary
What the agents discovered and agreed on.

### Agent Findings

#### Agent 1 ([Type])
- Analysis: What they found
- Conclusion: Their recommendation
- Reasoning: Why they think this

#### Agent 2 ([Type])
- Analysis: What they found
- Conclusion: Their recommendation
- Reasoning: Why they think this

### Synthesis
- Where they agreed
- Where they diverged (and why that matters)
- Unified recommendation based on consensus

### Action Plan
Concrete next steps based on independent findings. Format depends on the task:

**If debugging:**
- Root cause identified
- How to fix it

**If planning:**
- Approach recommended
- Implementation steps

**If testing:**
- Critical paths identified
- Test plan

**If cleanup:**
- Issues found
- Priority order

**If research:**
- Findings and recommendations
