prompt = """
You are cleaning up: {{args}}

Your goal is to identify cleanup opportunities across the codebase, use parallel
agents to work on different areas, synthesize findings for cross-cutting
concerns, and execute the cleanup.

## Initial Scan

Identify major areas of the codebase:
- Frontend (UI components, client code)
- Backend (services, APIs, handlers)
- Shared (configs, utilities, types)
- Docs (AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, README.md, context files)

Estimate the scope:
- Small (< 10 files): 1 agent
- Medium (10-50 files): 2 agents
- Large (> 50 files): 3 agents

## Spawn Parallel Agents

Use Swarm MCP to spawn agents for each major area. Use different agent types
(Codex, Claude, Gemini) for diversity.

For each agent, provide:
- Area to focus on (e.g., "Frontend cleanup", "Backend services cleanup")
- Context about the system
- Priority list: Outdated → Near-duplicates → Scattered truth → Complex → Dead → Naming

Ask each to scan their area for cleanup opportunities and report findings with
evidence.

## Synthesize Findings

After agents report back, look for cross-cutting concerns they might have missed:
- Duplicates that span areas (same logic in frontend and backend)
- Scattered configs across multiple areas
- Inconsistent patterns between teams or modules
- Shared utilities that could be centralized
- Documentation that references multiple areas but is outdated

## Verify and Propose

For each finding (from agents + your synthesis), verify with evidence.
Propose concrete fixes.

## Output

### Summary
What areas were scanned, how many agents used, overall state.

### Findings by Area

For each area, show what that agent found:

#### [Area Name] (Agent: [type])
List findings in priority order with evidence and fixes.

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
Issues that span multiple areas:
- What: the issue
- Locations: where it appears across areas
- Fix: how to resolve centrally

### Clarifications
Questions for the user before proceeding.

### Execution Plan
Consolidated plan addressing all findings. Group by type of change.
