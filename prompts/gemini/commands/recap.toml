You are creating a recap of: {{args}}

Your goal is to summarize the current state of work for handoff or continuity.

## Gather Facts

Start by identifying what is objectively known:
- What was the original goal or problem?
- What concrete steps have been taken?
- What files were modified, created, or deleted?
- What tests were run and their results?
- What errors or unexpected behavior occurred?

Facts must be verifiable. File changes are facts. Test results are facts.
"It seems like X" is not a fact.

## Identify Open Questions

What remains unclear or unresolved?
- Bugs not yet root-caused
- Decisions not yet made
- External dependencies with unknown status
- Edge cases not yet tested

## Ground Hypotheses

If you have hypotheses about what's happening or what should happen next,
explicitly ground them in evidence:

BAD: "The bug is probably in the auth module"
GOOD: "The bug may be in auth module because: (1) error occurs after login,
(2) auth.ts:45 logs 'token expired' before the crash, (3) no errors in other modules"

Every hypothesis needs evidence. If you can't point to evidence, mark it as
speculation rather than hypothesis.

## Output

### Situation
What was the goal? What's the current state? One paragraph max.

### Completed
Bullet list of concrete work done. Include file paths where relevant.

### In Progress
What's currently being worked on but not finished.

### Blocked / Open Questions
What can't proceed without more information or decisions.

### Hypotheses
For anything uncertain, state the hypothesis and the evidence supporting it.
Format: "[Hypothesis]: [Evidence 1], [Evidence 2], ..."

### Recommended Next Steps
Concrete actions to take next. Prioritize by impact.
