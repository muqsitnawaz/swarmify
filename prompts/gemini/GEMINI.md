## Gemini Added Memories
- Implemented Twitter token support in the harness HTTP tools, specifically for the rush CLI and agents. This involved updating `harness/agent/types.go`, `harness/agent/builder.go`, `rush/cli/internal/cli/run.go` and `agents/content-writer/agent.yaml`.
- Implemented ApplicationToolRunner service in rush/app/src/services/application-tool-runner.ts for executing Twitter and Gmail tools via halo/proxy API.
