description: Improve a solution with parallel exploration from Swarm agents
---

You want to improve: $ARGUMENTS

Spawn 2-3 Swarm agents to think about this from different angles.

Give each agent the problem context and a direction to explore. The directions depend on the problem - could be research, could be alternative approaches, could be edge cases, could be user perspectives, could be debugging hypotheses.

Collect their ideas. Improve your solution.
